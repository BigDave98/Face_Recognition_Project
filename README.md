# FaceRecognition Project

The FaceRecognition project was created to enhance my programming skills in Python and expand my knowledge with the technologies used.

## How to Use

Using the system is simple, you just need a webcam on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Add an image with the person's name in the `Imgs` folder.
2. Run the `FaceRecognitionProject.py` file.
3. The person in the photo should appear in front of the webcam. Once the person has appeared in front of the webcam, their name will be saved in the `DataBase.csv` file.

## How It Works

To make this project possible, the main libraries used were `face_recognition` and `cv2`. These libraries greatly simplify all the image processing performed during the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BigDave98/FaceRecognition
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Project

Run the `FaceRecognitionProject.py` file:
```bash
python FaceRecognitionProject.py
